  <h1>Flowers </h1>
<p>
  In a garden filled with butterflies, bees, leaves, and trees <br>
  Hundreds of flowers are blossoming <br>
  Blossoming into who they truly are, whatever or whoever that may be <br>
  in their petals their journeys slowly unfold <br>
  <br>
  Their garden, their community <br>
  Allows them to be free and not worry about anything else <br>
  Nothing bothers them <br>
  Not the thorns <br>
  The annoying bees <br>
